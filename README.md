# BinaryStringRW
#read out binary as string and write binary (string) in files to reduct.
#本算法用来测试将二进制以字符串的形式读出与将字符串（二进制形式）写入原文件，保存数据不变
------------------------------
this algorithm is used to read file's binary out as string then write those binary(string) into a new file to reduct the raw file

any way,hope this algorithm can help you.
I mean,when you read a file's binary out,you know,you can analyize it,then,you know what can you do with it.
but there are still some problems,like portable,or the effectiveness.
so I hope you guys can help me to fix it,make it much better. :)
